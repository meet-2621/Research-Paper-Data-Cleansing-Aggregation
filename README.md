🧠 Project Overview

This mini data science project focuses on data cleansing and aggregation using Python’s Pandas library.
Raw data often contains missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting errors. Before performing any meaningful analysis, data must be cleaned and structured properly.

In this project, two sample datasets (Employee & Project data) were created and processed step-by-step using Pandas.
The tasks included:

Checking for missing values

Filling missing data with mode and mean

Performing string operations to standardize text

Merging datasets with join operations

Aggregating data using groupby()

Visualizing the average salary by department using Matplotlib

⚙️ Technologies Used
